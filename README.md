# Design patterns

## What does the pattern consist of?

Most patterns are described very formally so people can reproduce them in many contexts. Here are the sections that are usually present in a pattern description:

- **Intent** of the pattern briefly describes both the problem and the solution.
- **Motivation** further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible.
- **Structure** of classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related.
- **Code example** in one of the popular programming languages makes it easier to grasp the idea behind the pattern.

## Classification of patterns

  The most basic and low-level patterns are often called _idioms_. They usually apply only to a single programming language.

  The most universal and high-level patterns are _architectural patterns_. Developers can implement these patterns in virtually any language. Unlike other patterns, they can be used to design the architecture of an entire application.

 In addition, all patterns can be categorized by their intent, or purpose. This book covers three main groups of patterns:

  - **Creational patterns** provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
  
  - **Structural patterns** explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.

  - **Behavioral patterns** take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
